## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Your First Sound
Let's create your very first interactive sound:

1. **Open the Application**
   - Ensure "Draw: ON" is activated (green button)
   - Make sure you're in Layer 1 (top section)

2. **Draw Your First Shape**
   - Click and drag horizontally in the top layer
   - Try drawing a line about 200 pixels wide
   - Release the mouse to complete the shape

3. **Play Your Sound**
   - Click the "Play" button
   - Watch the red playhead move across your shape
   - Listen to the sound it creates!

4. **Experiment**
   - Draw at different vertical positions (changes pitch)
   - Try different widths (changes duration)
   - Draw curved lines for pitch bends

### Understanding the Interface

#### Visual Feedback
- **Blue circles**: Sine waves (smooth, pure tones)
- **Green triangles**: Triangle waves (warmer than sine)
- **Red sawteeth**: Sawtooth waves (bright, harsh)
- **Orange squares**: Square waves (retro, digital)

#### Audio Mapping
- **Vertical position**: Higher = higher pitch
- **Shape width**: Wider = longer duration
- **Line thickness**: Thicker = louder (amplitude)
